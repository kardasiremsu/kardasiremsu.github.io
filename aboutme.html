	Hello! My name is Iremsu Kardas and welcome my personal website.I most work with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Python.
	Since I graduated at Istanbul Technical UnÄ±versity, I am working at my office or my home as web developer and computer engineer. I am living in Istanbul at right now. But I must to travel different
	countries for conference about new technologies. In my free time, I am always in nature. Taking and editing landscape photo is meditation for me. 
	 When I spend an entire day in nature, I feel purified and rested. That's why I did scouting.
